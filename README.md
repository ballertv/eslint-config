# eslint-config
The "eslint-config" repository serves as a centralized location for maintaining and sharing a consistent ESLint configuration across multiple repositories. It contains an ESLint configuration file (typically named .eslintrc.js or .eslintrc.json) that defines the desired code style, rules, and settings for the associated projects.
